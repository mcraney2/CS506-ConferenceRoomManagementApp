NOTE: This project has a wide range of dependencies and installations. If you have any issues running it let us know.

Currently, the app only works running on a local server. Adding a network server will be part of a later implementation. It is best to download the Android Studio and launch an emulator and run the application from that. The server also needs to be started via terminal, the command is python backend_django/manage.py runserver.

1) You need to download and install Node.js
2 ) Team will develop with React Expo CLI as the development environment for the Rapid Prototype as opposed to React Native CLI (in regards to environment)
Download app here to view app: https://expo.io/
3) Install React Navigation - necessity for screen switching - have to download and install the navigation, and stack, and all others mentioned follow the directions through
4) Once you have cloned the github project to your local directory, open it via windows power shell and type expo start to run it
5) Make sure to start the database with the server command above as well
6) Click "Run with Android Emulator" from the page that expo launches

Postman is useful to help send requests to test the backend
1) To run tests - npm tests
